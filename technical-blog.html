              <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
              <p>Java Script which is popularly known as JS , is one of the most popular language of programming. It is the programming language mainly used for designing
                  web base applications. The main plus point about JavaScript is that it can not only run in the browser but also on the server and on every platform which has JavaScript
                  engine. And the best thing about it is that it supports almost majority of  bbrowsers like chrome, safari, IE .
                  Many big companies like Google, microsoft, apple are using javascript for thyeir web base develpoment. It is easy to learn as compared top other programming languages
                    and also it is user friendly.
                </p>
            

                <h2>Advantages</h2>
                Imagine you have to go to server side every time you want to do some random dynamic calculation.

                Imagine you have to refresh the whole page just to check if some one has left the form field empty.
                
                Imagine you have to show 40 images i a row of size 400X400.
                
                Imagine you are doing a user sign up and have to check if user email or username exist and you have to refresh whole page every time.
                
                These are very few problems which would not have been possible to solve without JavaScript and Web Surfing Experience would have been very boring .
                
                Time and space is precious my friend and JavaScript saves that.
                
                Thanks!</p>
