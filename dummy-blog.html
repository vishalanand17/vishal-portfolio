              <h2>Impact on IT sector people</h2>
              <p>One of the positive side of this pandemic is that most of the people who lives away from his/her home, whatever the reason be , maybe 
                  for studies and earning , got a chance to spend good time with their family members in their hometown. We know that in india , there are mainly 4-5
                  cities were IT hubs are situated like Banglaore, Hyderabd, Pune, Gurgao, N oida etc. So this pandemic forced the people working in IT sector
                  to work from home . So this policy created a good impact on people especiually living away from hometown , to go to their hometown and lives withy thyeir family
                  and also do tgheir office work from home . As a result of this , now companies are adopting a hybrid model of work which includes work from home as well
                  as work from  officfe depending on employees wish.
                </p>
